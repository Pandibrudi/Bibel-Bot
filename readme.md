#### Is it in the Bible?!
###### Let's find out!

I was shocked to find out that when people claim "this is not in the bible!" or "none of these words are in the bible" they often don't even know if they are correct. 

For this reason I developed a Flask App which uses the XML Versions from [Beblia](https://github.com/Beblia/Holy-Bible-XML-Format/tree/master) to search for occurences of a query in a bible version. 

At this point I only implemented the Luther Version (GER) but I will add an option to choose from different files. 

To run the app, just run `main.py` with Python.
